For our project we will impliment a databsae that will allow our Coffee Shop customers to sign in, collect points and recive a free drink when they reach a certain amount of points. 
Our database will be split into four parts. First part is the sign in part that will be implimented by Keita. Second part is creating a menu in the database and this will be done by Omid. Third part is order details and point allocation for each product, this part will be done by Shayan. Forth part is the "adding" section and payment, where all the points for customer get added up based on their purchases and it is decided if they can receive a free drink, this part will be done by Hardik.
